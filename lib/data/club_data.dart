        'So, welcome over … Glasgow Archers! We were formed in 1948 (when some of our members shot in pubs on dart boards against darts players!!!) and have catered for archers of all abilities and styles (except crossbow) throughout that time. From humble beginnings, the club has grown and contracted over the years depending on the current popularity of archery with club members spanning the generations. At last count we have more than 60 full members having recently taken on a dozen beginners just starting their archery journeys after completing their beginners courses. We also have quite a few associate members from other clubs. Post COVID, we are pleased to be a growing and active club once more.',
